Crisco is a 20% chorded keyboard inspired by the butterstick, originally created by [Germ](https://github.com/germ) at [gboards.ca](gboards.ca). The Crisco is bigger than it's cousin, being promicro-based instead of SMD, and MX switch spaced. But, it boasts LED strip support and an OLED 128x32 display.

Many thanks also to the [cookpad-pad repo](https://github.com/cookpad/cookpad-pad/tree/master), which jump started the build.
